# Aliens Go Home
Working from [this tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-games-with-react-redux-and-svg-part-1/) but adding other stuff. Goals:

* Different ammo types that you can get by successfully shooting out packages from the sky
* Ammo type examples: grapeshot (shotgun for cannon)
* Power-up where you create duplicate copies of your cannon (maybe to left and right of screen), and they shoot when you shoot at the same spot that you do
* Different enemy types that take a non-linear path down
* S-shaped path, sin-wave path
* visual indicator for when you lose a life (screen flash)
* 'boss' enemies that are tougher to kill but move more slowly -- taking multiple shots 
* explode-y bits for when you kill saucers
* add trees and clouds
